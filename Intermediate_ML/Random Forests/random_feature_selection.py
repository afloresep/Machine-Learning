We have ten decision treesâ€™ worth of predictions now
To meaningfully combine their predictions, We use the following system. If more than 5 classifiers predict that a datapoint belong to a certain class, we assign an aggregate prediction to that class.

The mean() function allows you to calculate the mean along a specific axis of the array. Axis 0 corresponds to the vertical axis (rows), while axis 1 corresponds to the horizontal axis (columns).

When you use mean(0), it calculates the mean along axis 0, which means it will compute the mean for each column separately
